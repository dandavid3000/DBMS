* Description
	* `PROJECT` table includes information about the project. Every project has `ProjectID` to distinguish with other projects. Every project has its name `ProjectName`, along with other information such as `DeadLine`, `Requirements`, `TypeID`, and maximum group number `MaxGroupNumber`.

	* `TYPE` table stores information about how to do this project. We have 
`TypeID` which means that `Project for groups` or `Personal project`, or `Extra assignment`

	* `PROJECTDETAIL` table shows which teacher is responsible for that project by using `ProjectDetailID`, and `TeacherID`. Many teachers are responsible for one project.

	* `PROJECTREGISTRATION` table includes information of sudents who registered (or groups). Which project did they register `ProjectID`, ID of students `GroupID`, and the day they registered `RegistrationDay`

	* `TEACHER` table shows information of teachers. Every teacher has his own ID `TeacherID` along with other information such as name of teachers `TeacherName`, phone number `PhoneNumber`, and email address `Email`

	* `STUDENT` table is similar to `TEACHER` table

	* `GROUP` shows information of registration groups. If the project is a personal project, group has only one student who is a group leader. There are `GroupID`, `GroupName`, `MemberNumber` How many member are there in the group, `LeaderID` ID of a group leader.

	* `GROUPDETAIL` table shows information of members in a group

	* `RULE` contains rules that set by teachers.
