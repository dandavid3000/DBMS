* Description
	* `PROJECT` table includes information about the project. Every project has `ProjectID` to distinguish with other projects. Every project has its name `ProjectName`, along with other information such as `DeadLine`, `Requirements`, `TypeID`, and maximum group number `MaxGroupNumber`.

	* `TYPE` table stores information about how to do this project. We have 
`TypeID` which means that `Project for groups` or `Personal project`, or `Extra assignment`

	* `PROJECTDETAIL` table shows which teacher is responsible for that project by using `ProjectDetailID`, and `TeacherID`. Many teachers are responsible for one project.

	* `PROJECTREGISTRATION` table includes information of sudents who registered (or groups). Which project did they register `ProjectID`, ID of students `GroupID`, and the day they registered `RegistrationDay`

	* `TEACHER` table shows information of teachers. Every teacher has his own ID `TeacherID` along with other information such as name of teachers `TeacherName`, phone number `PhoneNumber`, and email address `Email`

	* `STUDENT` table is similar to `TEACHER` table

	* `GROUP` shows information of registration groups. If the project is a personal project, group has only one student who is a group leader. There are `GroupID`, `GroupName`, `MemberNumber` How many member are there in the group, `LeaderID` ID of a group leader.

	* `GROUPDETAIL` table shows information of members in a group

	* `RULE` contains rules that set by teachers.

##### Store Procedure

Build store procedures to perform requirements.

* `sp_GVUpdateDA`
	* *Purpose*: Teacher wants to update old projects
	* *Variables*:
		* `@Ma_DA` *int* : Projet ID
		* `@TenDoAn` *nvarchar(50)* : Project name
		* `@dead_Lone` *datatime* : Deadline
		* `@yeu_cau` *nvarchar(50)* : Project requirements
		* `@MaHT` *int* : Type ID
		* `@SoLuongNhomToiDa` *int* : Max group number
		* `@SoLuongNhomToiDaDangKy` *int* : Number of group who registered projects
		* `@SoLuongGiaoVienToiDa` *int* : Max teacher number
		* `@SoLuongGiaoDaVienPhuTrach` *int* : Reponsible teacher number
	* *Process*:
		* Check the project
			* See if the project exists or not, if not shows errors, and quit.
			* Check the maximum group number
		* If it satisfies
			* Check max teacher number > reponsible teacher number
				* If it satisfies, then update new information
				* Else show errors.
		* IF it doesn't satisfy, show errors

	* *Code* 

		```sql 
		create proc sp_GVUpdateDA 
		@Ma_DA int ,@TenDoAn nvarchar(50),@dead_Line datetime , @yeu_cau nvarchar(50),@MaHT int,@SoLuongNhomToiDa int,@SoLuongNhomDaDangKy int,@SoLuongGiaoVienToiDa int ,@SoLuongGiaoVienDaPhuTrach int 
		as begin
		begin tran 
			if(not exists (select * from DoAn as DA where DA.MaDoAn=@Ma_DA)) 
			begin
				print 'Khong co do an nay'
		rollback
				return

					update DoAn set TenDoAn=@TenDoAn,DeadLine=@dead_Line,YeuCau=@yeu_cau,MaHT=@MaHT,SoLuongNhomToiDa= @SoLuongNhomToiDa,SoLuongNhomDaDangKy=@SoLuongNhomDaDangKy,SoLuongGiaoVienToiDa=@SoLuongGiaoVienToiDa,SoLuongGiaoVienDaPhuTrach=@SoLuongGiaoVienDaPhuTrach where(DoAn.MaDoAn=@Ma_DA)
